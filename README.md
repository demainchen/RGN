# RGN
The source code of RGN:Residual based graph attention and convolutional network for protein-protein interaction site prediction.

# Data:
All the dataset used in this work is saved in the 'data' files. The 72.txt,164.txt,186.txt,315.txt,1291.txt correspond the Dset_72,Dset_164,Dset_186,Dset_315,Dset_1291 respectly.
If you wan to test our model with your protein sequence, please make sure that you download the Blast++,HH-suite,DSSP in your device.
The Blast++ is used to make the PSSM matrix. The HH-suite is used to make the HHM matrix. The DSSP is used to make the dssp matrix. More information can be found in the manuscript.
